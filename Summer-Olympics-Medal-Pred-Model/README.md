# Project Overview

In this project, I will build a simple model and measure error against a dataset from historical Olympic Games. I will try and predict how many models a country will win based of historical and current data.

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Explore the data.
3. Reshape the data to predict your target (if required).
4. Clearn the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split the data into train and test.
7. Train the model.

**File Overview**

* `model.ipynb` - the main project code

**Python Packages** 

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* seaborn

## Data

We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).

It has been simplified down into `teams.csv`.
